# Introducing Works

## About Works

The Works module aims to achieve user satisfaction through quality, timely delivery and transparency in the effective execution of works by simplifying procedures to improve client interface, eliminate delays, improve responsiveness and service delivery, improve productivity, and avoid arbitration or litigation.

## Problems Addressed

With new emerging construction technologies gaining dominance over conventional construction practices and with the rising expectations of various stakeholders for timely delivery of the projects, there is a need for transformative changes requiring revision of the Works Module to make it more nimble, effective and delivery oriented, rather than being process-centric with obsolete provisions.

It should also be in consonance with the fundamental principles of service delivery, customer focus, efficiency, transparency, fairness, competition, economy and accountability.

## Approach

A Works Management System(WMS) typically is used by various departments in the government to track end to end lifecycle of a project (scope and finances).

The input to works could be a decision that is taken in the legislature for the construction of new capital works or demand that is generated from within society or officers, for maintenance of existing projects.

Examples:

1. Construction of new metro rail is of nature capital works (New Works)
2. Repair of existing roads is of nature operations and maintenance (O\&M)

Once the project is identified, the next step is the estimation of project costs. This is followed by tendering, contracting, sharing the work order with the contractor, tracking milestones, payments and closure.
