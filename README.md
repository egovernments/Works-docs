# Introducing Works

## About Works

The Works module aims to achieve user satisfaction through quality, timely delivery and transparency in the effective execution of works by simplifying procedures to improve client interface, eliminate delays, improve responsiveness and service delivery, improve productivity, and avoid arbitration or litigation.

## Problems Addressed

With new emerging construction technologies gaining dominance over conventional construction practices and with the rising expectations of various stakeholders for timely delivery of the projects, there is a need for transformative changes requiring revision of the Works Module to make it more nimble, effective and delivery oriented, rather than being process-centric with obsolete provisions.

It should also be in consonance with the fundamental principles of service delivery, customer focus, efficiency, transparency, fairness, competition, economy and accountability.

## Approach

A Works Management System(WMS) typically is used by various departments in the government to track end to end lifecycle of a project (scope and finances).

The input to works could be a decision that is taken in the legislature for the construction of new capital works or demand that is generated from within society or officers, for maintenance of existing projects.

Examples:

1. Construction of new metro rail is of nature capital works (New Works)
2. Repair of existing roads is of nature operations and maintenance (O\&M)

Once the project is identified, the next step is the estimation of project costs. This is followed by tendering, contracting, sharing the work order with the contractor, tracking milestones, payments and closure.

The platform design provides the capability to integrate smart payments with [iFIX](http://ifix.digit.org/).  The integration enables departments to track project milestones and simplify vendor payments. The multi-layer architecture design ensures transparency, visibility and fast decisions all of which translate to an accelerated pace of development. The registries and APIs ensure information flows seamlessly across channels removing the challenges of siloed data structures and facilitating interoperability.&#x20;

The platform architecture illustration below provides a visual representation of the key components and layers that facilitate a seamless flow of information across multiple departments. &#x20;

## Benefits

* Offers key capabilities required by state/dept/ULB/other entities to manage Works (New and Old)
* Interoperable with other applications such as engineering estimation, measurement, attendance tracking, and billing apps.
* Can make use of its own registries or existing shared registries for projects, assets, beneficiaries, contractors etc.
* Configurable for both ULBs and state departments & understands both books of accounts.
* Reports & dashboards with real-time data to monitor progress and make decisions
* Uses a template-based approach for creating & issuing new documents to save time and avoid mistakes
