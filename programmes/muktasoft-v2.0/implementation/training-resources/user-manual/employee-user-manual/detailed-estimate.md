# Detailed Estimate

A detailed estimate in construction refers to a comprehensive breakdown of the anticipated costs associated with a construction project. This estimate is a meticulous calculation that itemizes various components, materials, labour, and other expenses required for the successful completion of the project.&#x20;

The detailed estimate is typically created during the planning and design phase of a project and serves as a fundamental tool for budgeting, tendering, and project management.
