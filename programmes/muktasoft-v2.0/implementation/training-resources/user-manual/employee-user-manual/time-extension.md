# Time Extension

The time extension feature enables users to request an extension for the completion period of a project. This request becomes necessary when, for various reasons, the CBO is unable to complete the project within the initially specified time frame. The capability to request a time extension is available to both the CBO and the Officer in-charge of the project.

## Inbox

The same inbox used for managing work orders is also utilized to track and process time extension requests.

## Search Time Extension Request

The search screen for work orders is also utilized to search for time extension requests.

## Create Time Extension Request

To initiate a time extension request, users can search for the original work order, view its details, and then, from the actions menu, select 'Create Time Extension.' This action opens the time extension page for users to fill in and submit the request.

## Workflow
