# UAT Planning

## Objective&#x20;

The purpose of this document is to outline the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) process for the MUKTA application developed on the DIGIT-Works platform for the implementation of the MUKTA scheme notified by the Government of Odisha. This will enable the ULB and CBO users to validate that the MUKTASoft application meets the agreed-upon acceptance criteria for various functionalities. It will ensure that the system satisfies the needs of the business as specified in the ( / ) and provides confidence in its use. It will also help to identify defects with associated risks and suggest enhancements(change requests), communicate all known defects/enhancements to the project team, and ensure that all issues are addressed in an appropriate manner prior to go-live.&#x20;

## Methodology&#x20;

During the testing process, a pre-approved list of test cases/scripts will be executed to verify the behavior and performance of various functionalities. The observations from the testing will be noted and classified as defects, enhancements, or clarifications. Some of the enhancements may be doable using configuration changes while others( Change Requests) may have to go through a change management process.
