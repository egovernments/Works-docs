# Revise Estimate

When the amount of work exceeds up to 10% more from originally estimated amount either due to rates being found insufficient or due to some other reasons, a revised estimate is prepared.&#x20;

1. A comparative statement is attached on the last page. It includes reasons for increase in cost in case of each item.&#x20;
2. The revised estimate should show the variation of each item of work, its quantity, rate and cost under original and revised.

Once a revised estimate is created, both the estimates can be searched and viewed for details. The original estimate will remain unchanged and reflects the original items and its measurements.
