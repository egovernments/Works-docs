# UAT Test Planning

## 1.0 Objective

The purpose of this document is to outline the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) process for the MUKTA application developed on the DIGIT-Works platform for the implementation of the MUKTA scheme notified by the Government of Odisha. This will enable the ULB and CBO users to validate that the MUKTASoft application meets the agreed upon acceptance criteria for various functionalities.

It will ensure that the system satisfies the needs of the business as specified in the functional requirements(PRD/ User Stories) and provides confidence in its use. It will also help to identify defects with associated risks and suggest enhancements(change requests), communicate all known defects/enhancements to the project team, and ensure that all issues are addressed in an appropriate manner prior to go-live.

## 2.0 UAT Methodology

During the testing process, a pre-approved list of test cases/scripts will be executed to verify the behaviour and performance of various functionalities. The observations from the testing will be noted and classified as defects, enhancements, or clarifications. Some of the enhancements may be doable using configuration changes while others( Change Requests) may have to go through a change management process.

UAT observation classification:

| # | Observation Type     | Description                                                                                                                                         | Addressing Mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| - | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Defects              | Any observation pertaining to a feature or functionality not working as expected or agreed at the time of scope review, will be classified as issue | The observations classified as defects will be taken up by the eGov program team for further validation, prioritisation and fixing. Minor issues originating due to incorrect configurations or erroneous labels, or translations will be fixed and be made available for re-testing during the next UAT cycle. |
| 2 | Change Requests (CR) | Any recommendations to enable or disable a functionality from the initial requirements or a new functionality to be added                           | These will be handled via Change control Process as per the SoP defined and will be evaluated based on their impact and effort.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3 | Clarifications       | A query which is related to usage of a system where the manual process would be slightly different from system process.                             | These will be clarified then and there with the help of department and document in the UAT sign off document.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The UAT team will execute all the test scripts referenced in section 6.0.  Users may also perform additional tests not detailed in the plan but remain relevant and within the scope of the project. &#x20;

Users will report feedback to the eGov team for documentation and escalation using a Google sheet. These defects will be described, prioritized, and tracked by using screen captures, verbiage, and steps necessary for the development team to reproduce the defect. For change requests the requirements will be described, analysed, prioritised and tracked.  Information on defect and CR processing can be found in section 7.0.
