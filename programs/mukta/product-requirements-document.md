### 3.5 Estimate

Estimate is a document which furnishes the quantities of different works involved, their rates and the expenditure anticipated towards a work.

Once the work proposal is approved with all the listed work in it, JE/AE has to prepare a detailed estimate of each and every work. In the system an abstract of the estimate is entered with an attached detailed estimate in PDF format to create an estimate and the same is then sent for technical and administrative approvals.

### 3.9 Work Review and Closure

The work should be declared as completed, only when all work items in that Work are found to be completed. A work item is considered to be completed if the quantity recorded in MB equals the estimated quantity.&#x20;

Hence, declaring a work completed seems to be an automated process but in reality, it does not happen this way as sometimes, ground reality demands an additional quantity of the work item even if the estimated quantity is already completed as per MB, sometimes the work-items are found completed on the ground even if the estimated quantity is not achieved in MB, and sometimes the Works demands additional work items to be included in the estimate. These scenarios are called deviations and a proposal to revise the estimate is prepared.

The request for the closure of the project can be initiated by SHG/ ULB (JE). Ideally, it is initiated by SHG and then the request is reviewed by ULB. The final bill has to be submitted if any payment is pending before approval of completion. The functional requirement is as given below.

1. Project closure will be initiated by SHG by clicking on in-progress Work Orders. This will take SHGs to fill out a closure checklist form.
2. Initiated project closure will land in the inbox of the checker for project closure. He/she will check related details to closure and submit them to the approver for closing approval.&#x20;
3. Approver upon marking the project as closed will finally close/complete the project. &#x20;
4. The closure will also need to be initiated by ULB by searching for projects in progress and closing them
5. Once closed projects will move to completed works in SHGs My Works. No new bills, muster rolls, or attendance tracking will be allowed.
