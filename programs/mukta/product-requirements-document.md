### 3.5 Estimate

Estimate is a document which furnishes the quantities of different works involved, their rates and the expenditure anticipated towards a work.

Once the work proposal is approved with all the listed work in it, JE/AE has to prepare a detailed estimate of each and every work. In the system an abstract of the estimate is entered with an attached detailed estimate in PDF format to create an estimate and the same is then sent for technical and administrative approvals.
