# MUKTA

Mukhyamantri Karma Tatpara Abhiyan Yojana ( MUKTA Yojana) is a government scheme and this scheme is aimed towards providing employment to the urban poor which also leads to improving the employment rate of the state.

MUKTASoft aims to improve the overall scheme efficiency of MUKTA by identifying & providing equal job opportunities to the urban poor, construct environment-friendly projects, develop local communities and slums & plan better for upcoming years.

MUKTASoft is a customisation of the basic Works platform. Not all base Works platform features need be utilised as part of this solution. Configuration will be MUKTA specific. UI screens will also be MUKTA specific. For more details, please see UI and configuration sections.&#x20;

MuktaSoft is a work in progress currently with a release targeted in H1 of 2023. Here's a sneak preview of the product demonstrating how daily wage seeker payments are made faster and more efficient through the use of Mukta! The demos also show wage seekers receiving SMS notifications on receipt of payment in their bank account.&#x20;
