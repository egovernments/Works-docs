# MUKTA

## Overview

Mukhyamantri Karma Tatpara Abhiyan Yojana ( MUKTA Yojana) is a government scheme aimed towards providing employment to the urban poor and consequently improving the employment rate of the state.

MUKTASoft aims to improve the overall scheme efficiency of MUKTA by identifying & providing equal job opportunities to the urban poor, constructing environment-friendly projects, developing local communities and slums & plan better in the upcoming years.

## Approach

MUKTASoft is a customisation of the basic Works platform. Not all base Works platform features need to be utilised as a part of this solution. The configuration is MUKTA-specific. UI screens will also be MUKTA-specific. Refer to [UI](../../platform/configuration/ux-mock-up-screens.md) and [service configuration](configuration/service-configuration/) sections for details.

MuktaSoft is a work in progress currently with a release targeted in H1 of 2023. Here's a sneak preview of the product demonstrating how daily wage seeker payments are made faster and more efficiently through the use of Mukta. The demos also show wage seekers receiving SMS notifications on receipt of payment in their bank account.&#x20;
