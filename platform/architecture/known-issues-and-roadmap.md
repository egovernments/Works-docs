# Known Issues & Roadmap

Following things are known issues that need to be addressed as part of the platform roadmap:

* Integration with error queue implementation for all services and requisite measures to fix them need to be in place. In case of unrecoverable failures, this will provide a way to alert and institute measures to fix.&#x20;
* Alert mechanisms when critical errors occur need to be in place especially with billing.&#x20;
* Offline & low connectivity use cases need to be handled as a best practice.
* Improved logging across services to help troubleshoot
* Enhancements to make attendance service configurable
* Offline & low connectivity use cases need to be covered for data reconciliation.
* Performance testing and benchmarking of services
* Security audit
