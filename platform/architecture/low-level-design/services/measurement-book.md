# Measurement Book

**About Measurement Book**:

1. Measurement Books are legal copies that are signed and issued by JE to the contractor noting down the Book ID, Number of Pages, Title (As per project title).
2. In offline methods, measurements can be filled daily, weekly, monthly or as per demand (Usually before the time of bill creation) to raise a bill and attach copy of m-book as a reference document validating the bill information.
3. Measurement Books are initially empty. The filling of M-Books will be done in reference to the estimate line items only. Once all the estimate line items are filled/counted in the MBook, it can be submitted along with the final Bill.
4. If an M-book pages are over, a new M-Book will be issued in a similar process
5. A single M-book cannot be used for more than 1 project.
6. M-book is also send as an attachment to accountant for bill approval.

**Need**:

1. Digitising the offline measurement books provide ways for faster & timely measurement capture, automated calculation, error free and automated billing.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Create M-Book when contract is accepted with the start and end dates as per contract
2. Allow user with necessary role to track measurements. Mostly a contractor. Sometimes a field supervisor or a community incharge etc
3. Measurements can be taken both on web and mobile. (Mobile First)
4. Measurement book initially will have line items from estimate with zero quantities. These will get filled as the project progresses and cannot go beyond what is estimated.
5. Measurement Book readings can be sent for approval for any duration/marked period, from the last marked period.
6. Once approved, that corresponding amount will be allowed to be paid to the contractor.
7. For a project closure, measurement book also needs to be submitted and closed. However all estimates need not be filled to close an MBook.
8. A measurement Book reading when tracked, it should be able to tell using analysis of rates, how much labour, material and other heads have been used, same like how estimates can be decomposed. This will help in automated billing for the material that is supplied.
