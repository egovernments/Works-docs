## Enhancements

It is a fresh development and getting released for the first time.

## Known Issues

The following things are known issues that need to be addressed as part of the platform roadmap:

* The payment status of bills needs to be updatable after offline processing.&#x20;
* Integration with error queue implementation for all services and requisite measures to fix them need to be in place. In case of unrecoverable failures, this will provide a way to alert and institute measures to resolve.&#x20;
* Alert mechanisms when critical errors occur need to be in place, especially with billing.&#x20;
* Offline & low connectivity use cases need to be handled as a best practice.
* Improved logging across services to help troubleshoot
* Attendance service and muster roll are to be made configurable by adding a unit of measurement.&#x20;
* Performance testing and benchmarking of services.
* Security audit.
