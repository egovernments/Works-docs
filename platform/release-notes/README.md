## Known Issues

The list below are known issues that need to be addressed as part of the platform roadmap:

* Multiple measurements can not be created at the same time for one contract.
* Integrated error queue implementation for all services along with the necessary measures for addressing issues, is required. In situations of unrecoverable failures, this setup will provide a means to trigger prompt alerts and implement corrective actions.
* Establishing alert mechanisms for critical errors, particularly in the context of billing, is required.&#x20;
* Managing offline & low connectivity use cases as a best practice.
* Improved logging across services to help troubleshoot.
* The expense service should include the workflow as part of the payload and push it into the Kafka topic for persistence.&#x20;
* Separate SMS-related localization from all services and migrate it to a dedicated service.
* Performance testing and benchmarking of services.
* Security audit.
* Multiple mdms-v2 calls in services, because mdms-v2 was returning only one master's response.
* Code refactoring of works-services like
  * Remove unused models
  * Change package names
  * Remove duplicate validation logic
