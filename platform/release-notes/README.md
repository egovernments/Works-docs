## Known Issues

The following things are known issues that need to be addressed as part of the platform roadmap:

* Alert mechanisms when critical errors occur need to be in place, especially with billing.&#x20;
* Offline & low connectivity use cases need to be handled as a best practice.
* Improved logging across services to help troubleshoot
* Expense service to push workflow as part of the payload into the Kafka topic for persistence.&#x20;

* Performance testing and benchmarking of services.
* Security audit.
