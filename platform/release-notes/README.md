* Expense service to push workflow as part of the payload into the Kafka topic for persistence.&#x20;
* Expense service & calculator to read effectiveFrom and effectiveTo dates from master data and pick rates accordingly.
* Remove SMS related localisation from all services and move to a separate service.
* Master data to be reviewed for all modules and state level master data to be added in master-config.json. Eliminate extra code in modules to strip out state level tenant.
* Performance testing and benchmarking of services.
* Security audit.
